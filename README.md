The tool used the libconfig-1.7.2 library to read in the parameter settings.  

The domain of the channel with the cylinder inside is parametrized and can be modified
with respect to resolution of the respective blocks. Spatial grading around the cylinder
is possible.

The meshes created by this tool were used to apply a Micro-Macro Parareal Algorithm to 
the laminar cylinder flow problem in OpenFOAM. See:
